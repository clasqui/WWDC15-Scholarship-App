# WWDC15 Scholarship App
This is the app I submitted to get a scholarship for Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2015. It's written entirely in Swift.   My app was **accepted** and I was awarded a ticket for the conference free of charge.  You can check a list of scholarship recipients at http://wwdcscholars.com
